### Description

This mobile application allows the users to:
1. Start a live trip
2. Preview the finished trip
3. Check all the locations, saved during a trip
4. See all the photos

#### 1. Live Trips

The users can start a live trip, by providing their current location and the desired name of the trip. The current weather is also saved. Once started, the application will follow the user and track the location. User can save locations during the trip and upload photos from their phone storage, or take a photo with the camera.

#### 2. Trip Preview

Every saved trip can be previewed in a Trips tab, which lists all the trips taken up to date. We can see their titles, date, distance, etc. as well as a detailed map with the route the user followed. Every trip also lists all the locations saved during the trip.

#### 3. Locations

All locations contain information about their parent trip, associated photos, reviews of a given location and additional information such as the date, or specific location (i.e. longitude & latitude).

#### 4. Photos

A gallery of photos is available to the user, containing all the photos takes/uploaded by the user. Apart from having location's information and a name it also fetches photo's metadata.
